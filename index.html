   In Central Asia (referring to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan), the issue of water scarcity has recently emerged as a critical concern in academic and public discourse and is increasingly recognised as a driver of socio-political tension and regional instability. Particularly in the Fergana Valley (here, referring to Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan), the growing imbalance between water demand and supply, the inefficiency of irrigation systems, and competing sectoral needs have intensified local and transboundary disputes over shared water resources (Hermans et al., 2024).
<p>
The pressures have accordingly intensified due to increasing temperatures, glacier retreat, and a higher frequency of droughts, especially in the summer when water demand is highest. In the valley's rural areas, where agriculture relies significantly on irrigation, fluctuations and uncertainties in water supply pose risks to food security and the livelihoods of local communities during the cropping season. Furthermore, the scarcity of water and limited access to clean drinking water are often primarily linked to geographical and climatic conditions, with political and economic factors further compounding the issue.

    In addition to this, institutional rigidity (ibid.) reflects deeper structural constraints linked to the political economy of irrigated agriculture in the region, as also observed in case studies during the 2023 and 2024 field trips. According to the farmers from Tajikistan’s Jabbor Rasulov district (former Proletarsk), approximately 60% of irrigated land continues to be dedicated to cotton cultivation—an ongoing legacy from the Soviet-era planned economy, where cotton was promoted as a strategic monoculture crop. The priority placed on cotton planting reinforces the hierarchical nature of water allocation by favouring crops that align with state interests rather than supporting diversified, farmer-led agricultural practices.

    <div class="headline"> <div class="main-headline">Concept</div> Water Scarcity</div>
    We begin by outlining the foundations of hydrosocial theory, introducing key concepts such as the hydrosocial cycle, power relations, and infrastructure politics.... we adopt a hydrosocial perspective that emphasises the co-production of water and society. In this view, water is not merely a natural resource moving through physical landscapes but a relational and political entity shaped by human interactions, institutions, and discourses. This lens enables a critical interrogation of state-defined hydrological boundaries, which often fail to capture the social and political interdependencies within watersheds (Strang 2015). Recognising the artificial nature of these boundaries reflects a core tenet of hydrosocial theory: that water flows are inherently entangled with power, governance, and spatial imaginations (Swyngedouw 2004)... Thus, the modernisation of irrigation in the Fergana Valley illustrates both the abstraction of water (as described by Linton 2014) and the reshaping of the hydrosocial cycle.
